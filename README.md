 This is a software tracer that runs exclusively on the GPU. This is a computer graphics project coded in GLSL, HTML/JavaScript, and WebGL. A majority of the project was created and provided by Cem Yuksel, a computer graphics professor at the University of Utah. The GLSL code is my original work, which utilizes formulas to calculate the bouncing of rays around the scene.
